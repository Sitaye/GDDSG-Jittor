    Input:
        train_data (pandas.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing the training dataset. This dataset must include
            feature columns as well as 'label' and 'orginal_label' columns, where 'label' represents the target
            variable used for model training.
    Output:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - models (list): A list of three trained classifier models [RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, LGBMClassifier].
            - best_a (float): The optimal ensemble weight for the RandomForestClassifier.
            - best_b (float): The optimal ensemble weight for the KNeighborsClassifier.
            - best_c (float): The optimal ensemble weight for the LGBMClassifier, computed as 1 - best_a - best_b.
    Function:
        This function orchestrates the training of an ensemble of three classifiers (RandomForest, KNeighbors,
        and LGBM) on the provided training dataset. It first splits the dataset into training and validation folds
        using stratified sampling. Subsequently, each classifier is trained on the training fold. A nested objective
        function is defined to optimize the ensemble weights using Optuna, aiming to maximize the training accuracy
        by combining the prediction probabilities of the three classifiers. The optimal weights and trained models
        are then returned.
